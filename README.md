# network security and cryptography systems (by sagemath)

In today's time, cyber cryptographic algorithms are used to transfer electronic data over the internet so that no third-party is able to read the data.  

SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It builds on top of many existing open-source packages: `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `matplotlib`, `Sympy`, `Maxima`, `GAP`, `FLINT`, `R` and many more. Access their combined power through a common, Python-based language or directly via interfaces or wrappers.
